      "review": "1984 is a dystopian novel that explores the dangers of totalitarianism. George Orwell’s depiction of a society under constant surveillance and control is chilling and thought-provoking. The book’s themes of government overreach and loss of individuality remain relevant today, making it a must-read for anyone interested in political philosophy.",
